# Zomato-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Zomato dataset to uncover valuable insights about the food and restaurant industry. Using powerful data visualization tools, this analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of various trends and patterns within the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises information about restaurants listed on Zomato, including features such as:
- Restaurant ID
- Restaurant Name
- Country Code
- City
- Address
- Locality
- Locality Verbose
- Longitude
- Latitude

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to identify significant patterns and gain insights into the restaurant industry. The following libraries are utilized for visualization:
- **matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **seaborn**: For making attractive and informative statistical graphics.

### Key Insights from EDA
- Distribution of restaurant ratings.
- Popular cuisines across different cities.
- Average cost for two in various locations.
- Relationship between ratings and price range.
- Analysis of online delivery and table booking features.

## Visualizations

The project includes a series of visualizations to present the findings:
- Bar plots to show the distribution of various features.
- Heatmaps to illustrate correlations between different variables.
- Pie charts to display proportions of categorical data.
- Scatter plots to identify relationships between numerical features.

## Conclusion

The project delivers a thorough analysis of the Zomato dataset, revealing crucial insights into the food and restaurant landscape. It demonstrates the effectiveness of EDA and data visualization in extracting meaningful patterns from the data.
